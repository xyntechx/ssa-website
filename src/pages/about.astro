            The Singapore Student Association (SSA) is a student organization
            that provides a close-knit family for students in UC Berkeley who
            are associated with or interested in the Singaporean culture.

            We do this by running numerous events throughout the year, ranging
            from social events like Friendsgiving, to professional events like
            company visits and graduate school talks. The picture above was
            taken during our Lunar New Year dinner in Spring 2024 - we made (and
            of course ate) dumplings!

        <p>
            We also collaborate with other culture-based student organizations
            on campus to promote each of our own distinct cultures and heritage.
            For example, we co-organized a Mid-Autumn Festival celebration with
            the Malaysian Student Association at Berkeley (MASA) and the
            Berkeley Indonesian Student Association (BISA). The picture you see
            here is of us making lanterns during that fun-filled evening!
